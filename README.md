# Key Features of Harness.io
Continuous Delivery (CD) â€“ Automates deployments with built-in verification, rollback, and GitOps support.

Continuous Integration (CI) â€“ Optional cloud-native CI with intelligent test selection and caching.

Feature Flags â€“ Safely roll out features with toggles (like LaunchDarkly).

Cloud Cost Management â€“ Optimizes cloud spending (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes).

Security & Compliance â€“ Automated security scans (STO) and compliance checks.

# How to Implement Harness.io in CI/CD
Step 1: Set Up Harness Account
Sign up at Harness.io.

Install the Harness Delegate (a lightweight worker that runs deployments in your infra).

Step 2: Connect to Your Code Repository
Link GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. to fetch your application code.

Step 3: Define Your Pipeline
Create a New Pipeline (e.g., myapp-deployment).

Add Stages:

Build Stage (if using Harness CI) â†’ Compile code, run tests, build Docker images.

Deploy Stage â†’ Deploy to Dev/QA/Prod (Kubernetes, ECS, VMs, etc.).

Step 4: Configure Deployment Strategy
Canary Deployments (gradual rollout to users).

Blue-Green Deployments (zero-downtime switch).

Rolling Deployments (default for Kubernetes).

Step 5: Add Automated Verification
Automated Rollback if health checks fail (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic).

Manual Approval Gates before production.

Step 6: Deploy & Monitor
Trigger deployments via Git commits, Jenkins, or Harness UI.

Monitor logs, performance, and cost in Harness dashboards.

ðŸ”§ Example: Kubernetes Deployment with Harness
Define a Kubernetes Manifests (YAML) or Helm Chart.

Set Up a Harness Service â†’ Point to your Docker image (e.g., myapp:latest).

Configure Infrastructure â†’ Connect to your K8s cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS).

Run Pipeline â†’ Harness deploys, verifies, and rolls back if needed.
