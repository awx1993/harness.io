# Harness.io
DevSecOps demo
# Key Features of Harness.io
Continuous Delivery (CD) â€“ Automates deployments with built-in verification, rollback, and GitOps support.

Continuous Integration (CI) â€“ Optional cloud-native CI with intelligent test selection and caching.

Feature Flags â€“ Safely roll out features with toggles (like LaunchDarkly).

Cloud Cost Management â€“ Optimizes cloud spending (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes).

Security & Compliance â€“ Automated security scans (STO) and compliance checks.

# How to Implement Harness.io in CI/CD
Step 1: Set Up Harness Account
Sign up at Harness.io.

Install the Harness Delegate (a lightweight worker that runs deployments in your infra).

Step 2: Connect to Your Code Repository
Link GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. to fetch your application code.

Step 3: Define Your Pipeline
Create a New Pipeline (e.g., myapp-deployment).

Add Stages:

Build Stage (if using Harness CI) â†’ Compile code, run tests, build Docker images.

Deploy Stage â†’ Deploy to Dev/QA/Prod (Kubernetes, ECS, VMs, etc.).

Step 4: Configure Deployment Strategy
Canary Deployments (gradual rollout to users).

Blue-Green Deployments (zero-downtime switch).

Rolling Deployments (default for Kubernetes).

Step 5: Add Automated Verification
Automated Rollback if health checks fail (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic).

Manual Approval Gates before production.

Step 6: Deploy & Monitor
Trigger deployments via Git commits, Jenkins, or Harness UI.

Monitor logs, performance, and cost in Harness dashboards.

ðŸ”§ Example: Kubernetes Deployment with Harness
Define a Kubernetes Manifests (YAML) or Helm Chart.

Set Up a Harness Service â†’ Point to your Docker image (e.g., myapp:latest).

Configure Infrastructure â†’ Connect to your K8s cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS).

Run Pipeline â†’ Harness deploys, verifies, and rolls back if needed.

# âœ… Benefits of Using Harness in CI/CD
âœ” Faster Deployments â€“ Automates manual steps.
âœ” Fewer Failures â€“ Auto-rollback if something breaks.
âœ” Cost Savings â€“ Optimizes cloud resource usage.
âœ” Security â€“ Built-in security scans.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing Harness.io with Azure DevOps Pipelines
This guide explains how to integrate Harness CD with Azure DevOps for automated deployments, approvals, and rollback strategies.
# Prerequisites
Azure DevOps Account (with a repository containing your app code).

Harness.io Account (Sign up here).

Docker/Kubernetes/VM Target (where your app will deploy).

Azure Service Principal (for Azure Cloud deployments) (optional).

# Step 1: Install Harness Delegate (Agent)
Harness uses a Delegate (lightweight worker) to execute deployments in your environment.

1.1. Set Up a Delegate
Log in to Harness â†’ Project Setup â†’ Delegates.

Click + New Delegate â†’ Docker/Kubernetes/Shell Script.

Run the provided command in your Azure VM, AKS, or local machine:
# Example (Kubernetes)
kubectl apply -f harness-delegate.yaml

Verify the Delegate is connected (Status = Active).

# Step 2: Connect Azure DevOps to Harness
2.1. Add Azure DevOps as a Code Repository
In Harness, go to Project Settings â†’ Connectors.

Click + New Connector â†’ Azure Repos.

Enter:

Azure DevOps Organization URL (https://dev.azure.com/{org})

Personal Access Token (PAT) (from Azure DevOps)

Test & Save.

# Step 3: Create a Harness Pipeline for Azure DevOps
3.1. Define a New Pipeline
Go to Pipelines â†’ + New Pipeline.

Name it (e.g., azure-devops-to-aks).

Select Deployment Type (Kubernetes, Azure Web App, VM, etc.).

3.2. Configure Pipeline Stages
A. Build Stage (Optional - if not using Azure DevOps CI)
If using Azure DevOps Build Pipelines, skip this.

If using Harness CI, define:

Build Infrastructure (Harness Cloud or Self-Hosted).

Build Steps (e.g., docker build, mvn package).

B. Deploy Stage
Add a Deployment Stage â†’ Choose Kubernetes/Azure Web App/VM.

Define Service:

Name: my-azure-app

Artifact Source: Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub.

Define Infrastructure:

Cluster Details (AKS, EKS, etc.).

Namespace (default or custom).

Define Execution Steps:

Rolling Deployment (default for Kubernetes).

Canary Deployment (gradual traffic shift).

Blue-Green (zero-downtime switch).

# Step 4: Trigger Harness from Azure DevOps
4.1. Option 1: Webhook Trigger (Recommended)
In Azure DevOps Pipelines, add a Webhook after the build.

In Harness, go to Triggers â†’ + New Trigger â†’ Webhook.

Copy the Harness Webhook URL.

In Azure DevOps, add a POST request to the Harness Webhook after a successful build.

4.2. Option 2: Harness API Call
Use Azure DevOps Pipeline Task (curl or PowerShell) to call Harness API:
curl -X POST "https://app.harness.io/gateway/pipeline/api/webhook/custom/..." -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Step 5: Add Verification & Rollback
5.1. Automated Health Checks
Integrate with Azure Monitor, Prometheus, or Datadog.

If metrics fail â†’ Auto-Rollback.

5.2. Manual Approvals
Add an Approval Step before production deployment.

# Step 6: Run & Monitor
Trigger a Build in Azure DevOps â†’ Harness picks up the artifact.

Check Harness Deployments â†’ Logs, success/failure status.

Rollback Automatically if health checks fail.

** Example: Deploying to AKS **
Azure DevOps Build â†’ Pushes Docker image to ACR.

Harness Pipeline â†’ Pulls image, deploys to AKS.

Verification â†’ Checks pod health via Prometheus.

Rollback â†’ If errors occur, reverts to the last stable version.

# Harness Pipeline YAML Example for Azure DevOps Integration
Here's a complete YAML example for a Harness pipeline that deploys a Dockerized application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) triggered by an Azure DevOps (ADO) pipeline.

Pipeline Overview
Trigger: Azure DevOps build completes â†’ Webhook triggers Harness.

Stages:

Build (Optional, if using Harness CI)

Deploy to AKS (Rolling Deployment)

Features:

Automatic rollback on failure

Health checks using Azure Monitor

Harness Pipeline YAML ----->harness.yaml

# Trigger Configuration (Azure DevOps â†’ Harness)
Add this webhook trigger in Harness to listen to Azure DevOps events:

# How to Use This Pipeline
Replace Placeholders:

azure_acr_connector â†’ Your Azure Container Registry connector in Harness.

aks_connector â†’ Your AKS Kubernetes connector in Harness.

azure_devops_repo â†’ Your Azure Repos Git connector.

Set Up the Webhook in Azure DevOps:

In your ADO build pipeline, add a webhook notification to Harness:

<img width="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17f3806-eed8-403f-b87f-4489a0378214" />

Run the Pipeline:

Push a change to Azure Repos â†’ ADO build runs â†’ Harness deploys to AKS.

** Key Features in This Example **
âœ” Kubernetes Rolling Deployment (Zero-downtime updates)
âœ” Automatic Rollback (If health checks fail)
âœ” Artifact from Azure Container Registry (ACR)
âœ” Manifests stored in Azure Repos Git
âœ” Webhook Trigger from Azure DevOps

Solution Overview
Azure DevOps Build Pipeline â†’ Builds & publishes artifact (ZIP/JAR).

Harness Pipeline â†’ Deploys artifact to Azure Web App.

Trigger â†’ ADO pipeline completes â†’ Harness deploys via Webhook.

Step 1: Set Up Harness for Azure Web App
1.1. Install Harness Delegate
